This is a helper script for make-pretty-timed-only-diff.sh.


USAGE: make-each-time-file-only-diff.sh MAKE-COMMAND NEW_FILENAME [OLD_FILENAME]

MAKE-COMMAND: The command which is used to make the library, such as
              `make` or `make -j2`

NEW_FILENAME: The name of the file to store the output of timing the
              compilation of the current state of the library

OLD_FILENAME: The name of the file to store the output of timing the
              compilation of the most recently committed state of the
              library.  If given, `git stash` is used to obtain the
              most recently committed state.  If this script is
              interrupted or finishes, `git stash pop` is used to
              restore the present state.  This means that all relevant
              files must be tracked by git to be handled properly.
