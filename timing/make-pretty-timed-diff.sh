# Record the compilation performance of the current state of the
# library and the previous state, and compare them.
#
# USAGE: etc/timing/make-pretty-timed-diff.sh -j<NUMBER OF THREADS TO USE>
#
# This script creates a file ($BOTH_TIME_FILE in
# etc/timing/make-pretty-timed-defaults.sh) with the duration of
# compilation of each file that is compiled by `make`, as well as the
# total duration, of both the current state of the library and the
# most recent commit.  Any arguments passed to this script are passed
# along to `make`.  Argument quoting is NOT preserved.  This script
# supports multiple threads (the `-j<n>` arguments to `make`).
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: The performance will be successfully computed even
# if some files in the library fail to compile, so do not use the
# success of this script as an indicator that the library compiles.
#
# This script uses `git stash` to save the current state of the
# repository.  This script is most useful after you have run `git add`
# on all of the files, and are preparing to make a commit, but have
# not yet committed (you have staged your changes, but not commited
# them).  The preferred way to run this script is:
#
# $ git status
# $ git add <all files mentioned above which you care to have in the repo>
# $ "$DIR"/make-pretty-timed-diff.sh
# $ git commit -at ./time-of-build-both.log
#
# This will bring up an editor, where you should add your commit
# message above the time profile, leaving at least one blank line
# before the table.  You may pass, e.g., -j2 to this script to have it
# use more threads.  You should not exceed the number of cores on your
# machine, or else the timing will not be accurate.
