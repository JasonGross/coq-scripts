# Record the compilation performance of the current state of the
# library
#
# USAGE: etc/timing/make-pretty-timed.sh -j<NUMBER OF THREADS TO USE>
#
# This script creates a file ($SINGLE_PRETTY_TIME_FILE in
# etc/timing/make-pretty-timed-defaults.sh) with the duration of
# compilation of each file that is compiled by `make`, as well as the
# total duration.  Any arguments passed to this script are passed
# along to `make`.  Argument quoting is NOT preserved. This script
# supports multiple threads (the `-j<n>` arguments to `make`).
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: The performance will be successfully computed even
# if some files in the library fail to compile, so do not use the
# success of this script as an indicator that the library compiles.
#
# This script is most useful after you have already committed your
# changes, or when you do not care about comparing the current state
# with a previous state.
